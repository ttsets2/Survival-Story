            The moonlight shone dimly through the canopy. The cool breeze blew by as
            <br> you made your way back to the lifepod from the wreck site. You were looking
            <br> better now, the flesh no longer digging into your bones. To repent you
            <br> had dug a grave for each person you had to sacrific. You had gotten better
            <br> at hunting by now. No longer needing to commit a crime against your own
            <br> humanity just to survive.
            <br>
            <br> You had amost given up on being rescued by now. Over three months had already
            <br> gone by and there was still no sign of rescue. You had almost lost all sense
            <br> of feeling. You had thought about suicide more than a few times but the
            <br> ghost of Amy was still there. Keeping you alive and still going. You had
            <br> forgiven her by now. Thankful that she was always there keeping you sane,
            <br> in a way.
            <br> <b>BOOM</b> Suddenly a loud noise rang throughout the night. You looked up in
            <br> haste just in time to see a large fireball streak across the sky towards the
            <br> wreck. You almost didn't believe what you were seeing were it not for the the
            <br> earth itself rumbling in response to the invader.
            <br>
            <br> In disbelief you began to run. You tripped over a few roots but you didn't care.
            <br> The possibility of finally being rescued was too great. You burst through the
            <br> leaves and bushes and tumbeled onto the field. Standing in front of you stood
            <br> humans. Actual people that you hadn't seen in ages. You fell onto your knees
            <br> shocked. Tears that you hadn't cried in so long began to flow once more.
            <br> But despite it all you could only think one thing. <b><i>"I'm sorry Amy."</i></b>
