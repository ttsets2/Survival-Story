            The sun finally rose after an eternity. Your eyes puffed and bloodshot from the
            <br> tears that you had cried. With a groan you opened the hatch as sunlight filled
            <br> the pod. You didn't want do anything other but wither away but the memory of
            <br> Amy looking at you through the window with that smile on her face got you to
            <br> move. 
            <br> 
            <br> After a quick bathroom break you began to take account of your supplies.
            <br> Which wasn't much, most of it was in the survival kit from the lifepod.
            <br> With a sigh you grabbed the tarp and tape to make a makeshift bag for water.
            <br> You had alrady begun to feel thirsty so you had to get water first.
            <br>
            <br> After topping off the water tank in the life pod you began to think about
            <br> food. There was biological life here and the life pod can clean it up for you.
            <br> The question was could you capture it? The easiest option was probably the river.
            <br> 
            <br> With new found purpose you began to make a spear to fish in the river with.
            <br> You didn't want to, no you couldn't waste this chance that Amy has given you.
            <br> If you couldn't survive for yourself, you'd survive to tell her parents yourself.
            <br>
