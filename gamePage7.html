            You approached the wreck site in front of you. The fires had long since
            <br> died out. All that remained was a husk of the ship. It was the first
            <br> you had been here since you escaped through the life pod. You almost
            <br> wished you could escape and run away. Put everything behind you and
            <br> and just disappear into the wilderness.
            <br>
            <br> But against the potests of your consience you pushed forward. The smell was
            <br> awful, the smell of oil and metal permeated the air. Masking any other scent
            <br> that may have been present. But the worst of all was the sheer number of
            <br> cryopods strewn out across the field. As you walked past the cryopods you
            <br> recognized the name on a few of the pods.
            <br> 
            <br> You looked at the wreck, You wanted to check for food inside the wreck but
            <br> looking at the state of the ship. You knew it was not possible. What foor
            <br> that had survived the crash had already been lost in the ensuing fire. You
            <br> kept going through the fields until finally you came across the pod of
            <br> someone you didn't know. You couldn't bring yourself to look at their face.
            <br> You just spoke a soft <i> sorry </i>.
            <br> 
            <br> With a huff you lifted the pod and began to drag it away.
            <br>
