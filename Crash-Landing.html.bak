<p>
You never imagined that you would die here.
</p>
<p>
The memories of all your loved flashed before you.
</p>
<p>
The ship was lost and there was no escaping the planet's gravity.
</p>
<p>
You were gonna crash into the planet,
</p>
<p>
you were gonna burn up in the atmospher,
</p>
<p>
and there was no hope of escape.
</p>
<p>
The escape pod was jammed and wouldn't launch and you were stuck inside it.
</p>
<p>
Unable to try other escape pods.
</p>
<p>
The least you hoped for was that your death would be quick.
</p>
<p>
You stared at that red flashing  MALFUNCTION on the screen in contempt.
</p>
<p>
Till the ship started to shake from slamming into the air.
</p>
<p>
Slowly the shaking began to increase till you shut your eyes.
</p>
<p>
Sound envolping the entire ship as it slammed into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly you were slammed to the side of your seat.
</p>
<p>
The escape pod launched! Elation filled you as you began to hope.
</p>
<p>
You felt the parachute open as the escape pod slowly fell to the earth.
</p>
<p>
Worry filled you again as you began to think about how you would survive.
