            The wind rustled through the leaves giving off a peaceful athmosphere.
            <br> But in the distance the raging fire of the crash site lit up the sky.
            <br> Shattering any illusion to that you might have held that the ship was intact.
            <br> You don't know much about survival, but what little you did might just save you.
            <br>
            <br> Luckily you don't have to worry about a shelter due to the lide pod.
            <br> Suddenly you remembered something and ran back into the life pod. Your worst
            <br> nightmare had come true. You didn't have any food or water. The life pod could
            <br> render food edible but you would have to catch the food your self.
            <br>
            <br> Stepping out, you had a limited amount of energy. You had to scout the area you
            <br> landed in first while you still could and find water. Not to mention that the
            <br> sun was already getting low in the sky. Still in shock but determined  you set out.
            <br>
            <br> The forest was dense and tugged at your flight suit but the material held on.
            <br> You had begun to search to by putting the crash site on your right heading
            <br> downhill. If you were going to find water it was going to be at the bottom of the
            <br> valley.
            <br>
            <br> You made finally managed to make your way through the foliage and came across
            <br> a river. Rejoicing at your luck you approached the banks.
