            You never imagined that you would die here.
            <br>The memories of all your loved flashed before you.
            <br>The ship was lost and there was no escaping the planet's gravity.

            <br>You felt the parachute open as the escape pod slowly fell to the earth.
            <br>Worry filled you again as you began to think about how you would survive.
