            You landed on the ground safely. Luckily the reactor, as per security
            <br> protocol, had already been shut off so there was no danger of radiation.
            <br> A silent vibration coursed through the caosule as it began to open.
            <br> The wall embedded screen flickered to life as it began to display information.
            <br>

            <br> You froze. Staring at the last two words flashing in red. Mocking you.
            <br> Quickly you struggled to get out of the seat and jumped towards the screen.
            <br> Going through every single menu, activating every single sensor, even
            <br> bringing up the last known state of the ship. But all of it mocked your efforts.
            <br> You were alone. Alone on an alien world, the last one to be left.
            <br> With a shaky step you walked towards the door and opened it.
            <br>
            <br> <i><b>You still had to live.</b></i>
