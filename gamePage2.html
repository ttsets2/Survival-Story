            Unfortunately the water was murky but you couldn't be choosy
            <br> the lifepod could clean it for you. As you stood there at the bank, the
            <br>reality of your situation began to fully hit you. Everyone else was dead.
            <br> Jon, Keo, Xia, Amy, Wong, they were all gone. Your mind drifted to the moment
            <br> before the escape pod launched.
            <br>
            <br> The scent of smoke, the suffocation from the lack of oxygen. Amy's face in
            <br> the port window as she smiled at you. You saw her lips move but you couldn't
            <br> make it out before the lifepod launched. She saved you, but it had cost her,
            <br> her life. Guilt hit you as you realized that she could have survived were
            <br> it not for you. Tears began to form as your emotions took over
            <br>
            <br> She should have been the one to survive. Her family was waiting for her but
            <br> now they would never meet again. If at least it was you there would have been
            <br> no one else to mourn you.  <i>DON'T THINK LIKE THAT!</i>  Suddenly you snapped
            <br> out of it. Almost as if you heard Amy shout at you. Now wasn't the time to get
            <br> emotional. You could do that when you were no longer in danger.
            <br>
            <br> Examining the bank of the river you found the  remains of a half eaten
            <br>creature. Confirming both that a predator was nearby  and that there was
            <br> life in the river. Confirming the location you began to head back to the
            <br> lifepod before night set.
