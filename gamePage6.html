            As you made your way through the forest you stopped. There was something you
            <br> could do. A voice violently popped in and yelled at you <b>"ARE YOU FUCKING
            <br> INSANE!?!"</b>. You spoke back at the voice. <b>"YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA!?"</b>. The voice
            <br> didn't respond. But you didn't want to do it either. Just the idea of it made
            <br> you sick but if you did. You were definitely gonna die.
            <br>
            <br> The voice came back, quieter this time. <b>"Are you sure you want to surive
            <br> like this? There's no going back if you do this."</b> You paused, you knew the voice
            <br> was right. Not only would you change but the people around you would also
            <br> change. He'd become a monster to himself and others. But did he have a choice?
            <br>
            <br> Her accursed face appeared again but you couldn't tell what she wanted this time.
            <br> Was she encouraging him forward or telling him not to. You wondered about what
            <br> she would have done if she was here instead of you. But you couldn't think.
            <br> She seemed so distant now. Either because of time or because of your hatred
            <br> and love of her. You collapsed down as the non existent tears came out once more.
            <br>
            <br> After a while, you stopped. Your eyes blank with resignation. You didn't
            <br> want to think anymore. All you knew is that you didn't want to die hungry.
            <br> With dead eyes you set forth towards the wreck site.
            <br>
            <br>
