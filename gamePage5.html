            You bit your lips again. It had alraedy been 2 weeks since you landed on this
            <br> damn planet. You haven't caught a single animal yet despite the proof that it
            <br> existed. You had even tried making fish traps and yet you still failed to
            <br> catch something.  You already knew that if you didn't catch something in a
            <br> few days you'd die.
            <br>
            <br> Your nerves were already at the breaking point and hunger wasn't helping.
            <br> With a loud shout you threw the spear in your hand. It splashed into the water
            <br> and began to float away. You didn't care as you continued to scream and shout.
            <br> Sonn, however, your screams changed. Turning into a quiet laughter.
            <br> You considered if you should just give up. But Amy's face appeared again.
            <br> The face that had once been a source of comfort and motivation had been
            <br> corrupted and twisted into something that you hated.
            <br>
            <br> Despite that it still wouldn't let you give up. You took in a deep breath
            <br> and made your way to the shore. You sat down on the bank next to the large
            <br> boulder you named Keo and had drawn a face on. With a sign you began to
            <br> talk to it.
            <br> <b>
                I don't know what to do anymore Keo. I don't know how to live.
                <br>Amy's face haunts my dreams and thoughts and despite my efforts
                <br> I haven't even caught anything to eat.
            </b>
            <br> You sat there in silence before getting up and making your way back to the pod.
