            You looked back the planet below you. The Green forests expanding far into the
            <br> distance. A swath of blue that housed billions of living things. But despite
            <br> the beatury that you saw ahead of you. You could only see death. It was the
            <br> place where your friends had died. Where hundreds of others had died with

            <br> that forsaken planet. left to rot.
            <br> 
            <br> You took a deep breath again. Trying not to lose control of your emotions.
            <br> You remembered the last time you saw Amy again. Through that glass pane as
            <br> everything around her burned. She looked straight into her eyes and gave
            <br> you a sad smile. And she began to speak -
