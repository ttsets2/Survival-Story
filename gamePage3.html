            It was already dark by the time you made it back. The life pod had no lights,
            <br> and instead came equipped with infrared lights that were visible from space.
            <br> Though with the burning wreck nearby they hardly needed the lights from the
            <br> lifepod. You looked at the pillar of orange smoke. A feeling of frustration
            <br> briefly taking hold before you let it go.
            <br>
            <br> It was dark inside the lifepod. A measure to save the batteries. The solar
            <br> panels were damaged on reentry. Sitting in the dark you began to wonder again
            <br> your thoughts reaching for those dark crevices that lay in your subconsious.
            <br> The faces of your friends contorted and screaming in agony within the blaze.
            <br> You try to run to them but a wall stops you. They turn to face you and in
            <br> in unison began to speak. "You ran away without us! You left us to die!"
            <br> Their screams growing in intensity with each repetition.
            <br> Suddenly they charge at you, crossing the barrier that you couldn't.
            <br> But just before they grab you with their burning hands, you wake up.
            <br>
            <br> It was still night. You didn't know how much time was left till sunrise'
            <br> but you'd rather stay awake then fall asleep again. The tortured faces of
            <br> your friends still on fresh on your mind.
            <br>
            <br>
